Class Catcher

    This program logs into hokiespa with given credentials.  It then checks
a given list of classes to see if any are open.  If the class is open,
the user is notified so he or she can add/drop the class.  In the future,
we might make it possible to add/drop a class from the program itself.

Installation

    The script requires python 3.0.  It is possible it may work for previous
versions but is not guaranteed.  In order to compile the GUI, gtkmm-3.0-dev
and its dependencies are required.  You can obtain the source or binary
packages from http://www.gtkmm.org/en/download.html.  Conky is also necessary
to display the information on the desktop.  You can obtain these files from
http://conky.sourceforge.net/.

STEP 1:

    Run the configure script.  The configure script checks for dependencies
and updates all of the absolute directories for each script.

***********************************NOTE****************************************
If this folder is moved, it is necessary to re-run the configure script in order 
to update the new directories.
*******************************************************************************

STEP 2:
    Run the Makefile.  This c++ program is independent of the scripts and
therefore, not necessary to recompile after reconfiguring.

FINISHED:
    The main entry point is "classcatcher-client".  This script runs the GUI
for Class Catcher.  It is possible to just run "classcatcher" in the terminal
if you choose to.

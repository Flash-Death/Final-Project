Class Catcher

    This program logs into hokiespa with given credentials.  It then checks
a given list of classes to see if any are open.  The status of the class is
written to the desktop using a program called conky.  The main program is
"classcatcher-client" which runs the gtk.  However, the "classcatcher" script
can be run independently.

Installation

    The script requires python 3.0.  It is possible it may work for previous
versions but is not guaranteed.  In order to compile the GUI, gtkmm-3.0-dev
and its dependencies are required.  You can obtain the source or binary
packages from http://www.gtkmm.org/en/download.html.  Conky is also necessary
to display the information on the desktop.  You can obtain these files from
http://conky.sourceforge.net/.

STEP 1:
    Run the configure script.  The configure script checks for dependencies
and updates all of the directories for each script and cpp file.

STEP 2:
    Run the Makefile.

FINISHED:
    The main entry point is "classcatcher-client".  The program has been added
to the applications folder and can be searched for in Unity's search feature.
This script runs the GUI for Class Catcher.  It is possible to just run
"classcatcher" in the terminal if you choose to.

***********************************NOTE****************************************
If this folder is moved, it is necessary to re-run the configure script and
re-make the program in order to update the new directories.  DO NOT move the
files around in the folders.  The directories are hard-coded into the scripts
and program.
*******************************************************************************

CONFIGURATION:
    The Makefile generates a conky script called ".conkyrc_classcatcher" in the
etc/ directory.  You can configure it after running make.  If you re-run the
Makefile, you will have to reconfigure the conky script.
